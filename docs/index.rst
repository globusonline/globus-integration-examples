Globus Integration Examples
===========================

This documentation shows how to use the Globus `Auth API`_ with several popular Web application frameworks. 
The Auth API is a REST API hosted by the `Globus`_ group at the University of Chicago.
It is part of Globus's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for research, and it is freely available for use by the 
academic/research community. There are no licensing or per-use fees for the Auth API.
